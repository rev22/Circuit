This java application is an electronic circuit simulator.  When the application 
starts up you will see an animated schematic of a simple LRC circuit. 
The green color indicates positive voltage.  The gray color indicates ground.  
A red color indicates negative voltage.  The moving yellow dots indicate current.

To turn a switch on or off, just click on it.  If you move the mouse over any 
component of the circuit, you will see a short description of that component and 
its current state in the lower right corner of the window.  
To modify a component, move the mouse over it, click the right mouse button 
(or control-click if you have a Mac) and select “Edit”.

The application is an modification of the applet created by Paul Falstad. Added
are load and save of circuit files.
